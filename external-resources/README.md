# External Resources - greenhouse-forms.css

## Background
This is the stylesheet that is manually uploaded to greenhouse to customize the embeddwed application forms on the open-roles pages. Each new version will need to be updated in greenhouse by someone with admin access. Greenhouse has no version control so a copy is kept here for maintenance and review purposes.

## How to update the stylesheet in Greenhouse
* Navigate to bouncex.greenhouse.io/configure/dev_center/config
* In the "Configure another job board" dropdown, select "Wunderkind"
* Expand the Custom CSS URL section by clicking the pencil icon after the name of the current `.css` file

## Reminders
* Do NOT update outlines or display properties to resolve design issues.
* Do NOT update rules using the `.accessible` class unless the changes relate to accessibility
* DO test changes using a screen reader (Voiceover, NVDA)
* DO ensure form controls (inputs and buttons) are operable via keyboard, i.e. without needing to use a mouse
